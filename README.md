this dashboard was created for **Job Seekers, Job Transtioners, and Job Sweepers** to solve a common problem: information about the data job market is scattered and hard to grasp. Using a *real-world dataset of 2024 data science job posting* (Including titles, salaries, and locations), this project provides a single, easy-to-use interface to explore market trends and compernsation.
I made this dashboard as part of a learning tutorial was going through   

## Skills Showcased
- **Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating 
new columns.  
- **Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIS like Median Yearly Salary and Job Count'. 
- **Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Chart** to compare job counts and track trends over time.

- **KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data. 
- **Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story. 

- **Interactive Reporting:**
  - **Slicers:** to dynamically filter the report by job title
